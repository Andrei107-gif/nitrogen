Discord nitro gen 
Doesn't use discord tokens so should be fine but use a vpn and switch after if you wanna idk. 
Uses status codes to calculate if random nitro codes are valid - Do some maths and realise that this is made as a fun testing project - the chances of finding a code are low - but never impossible aha.
Could make this autoredeem if valid and use proxies and multithreading but my posts get literally 0 likes so I don't know why I even bother making these in the first place but meh
This is Demonstration purposes only as the farming of discord gifts is probably against their tos.
